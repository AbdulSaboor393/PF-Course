the approach i took to solve this problem is that i broke the question in two parts:
finding the smallest then the second smallest
 i set the value of smallest to a large number ike 9999
 the compared it to the elemnts of array then set the value of second smallest to 9999
and compared it to the smallest and other elements in the array


i learnt that you can compare array elements to an outside value rather than doing it with the array elements itself which helped me with this question.
